# Arch-Boki ISO


**Arch-Boki** is a customizable Arch Linux ISO builder based on the [Buildra](https://github.com/) [KIRO](https://github.com/kirodubes) projects. It provides a simple way to build your own Arch-based installation medium with your choice of packages, settings, and scripts. Compare the configs and search for references like ArcoLinux, arcolinux, kiro or buildra, arconet and ArcoNet and change them to your desired name for your custom iso. Use tools like rg (from ripgrep) and meld to compare.
